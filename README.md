## Core Contracts

### xDN404Base.sol

Base contract providing cross-chain DN404 functionality:

- `transferRemoteNFT()`: Transfer complete NFTs to remote chains
- `transferRemoteNFTPartial()`: Transfer partial NFT ownership
- `quoteTransferRemoteNFT()`: Get gas estimates for cross-chain transfers

### xMorse.sol

Main contract implementing the xDN404 standard:

- DN404 token implementation with cross-chain capabilities
- Upgradeable contract architecture
- Treasury integration for cross-chain operations

### xDN404Treasury.sol

Treasury contract managing cross-chain liquidity and operations:

- Handles incoming cross-chain messages
- Manages token reserves and distributions
- Supports partial ownership transfers

## Cross-Chain Operations

### Message Types

```solidity
enum MessageType {
    SEND_NFT,           // Full NFT transfer
    SEND_NFT_PARTIAL    // Partial ownership transfer
}
```

### Transfer Flow

1. **Ethereum ‚Üí Mitosis**: User calls `transferRemoteNFT()` on `xDN404Collateral`
2. **Message Processing**: Hyperlane delivers message to Mitosis chain
3. **NFT Minting**: `xDN404` contract mints corresponding NFT on Mitosis
4. **Reroll Execution**: Token ID mapping is updated for cross-chain consistency

### Reroll Mechanism

The protocol implements a reroll system that maps token IDs between chains:

- **Ethereum IDs**: `[1 | 2 | 4 | 7 | 9]`
- **Mitosis IDs**: `[3 | 5 | 6 | 8]`
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Token IDs are reassigned during cross-chain transfers to maintain consistency

## Security Features

- **Ownable2Step**: Two-step ownership transfer
- **UUPS Upgradeable**: Upgradeable contract pattern with access control
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Gas Limit Validation**: Gas estimation and validation for cross-chain operations

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-contract xMorse

# Run tests with verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Generate gas report
forge test --gas-report
```

## Gas Optimization

Gas optimization features:

- **Base Gas Limits**: 25,000 for ERC20 transfers, 50,000 for ERC721 transfers
- **Dynamic Gas Calculation**: Gas limits adjust based on operation complexity
- **Batch Operations**: Support for transferring multiple NFTs in single transaction

## Integration

### Hyperlane Integration

- Cross-chain messaging via Hyperlane protocol
- Gas router for cross-chain communication
- Hook system for custom message processing

### Mitosis Protocol

- Integration with Mitosis vault system
- Support for cross-chain liquidity operations
- Treasury management across chains
